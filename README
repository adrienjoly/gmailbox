Gmailbox 0.9: mbox retriever + POP3 server

I developed 2 python scripts to consult my gmail inbox off-line in my favorite email client (thunderbird):
- gmailretr.py downloads your inbox (or threads having the label of your choice) from your gmail account, using the libgmail API into a mbox file
- gmailboxpopd.py runs a POP3 server locally on which your favorite email client will connect to download your retrieved inbox (mbox file)

Use cases:
- you don’t have access to the internet, but someone else can bring your email back on a usb stick while keeping your privacy (emails are invisible, you don’t need to give your password)
- you have access to the internet for a short amount of time => you can download your emails online now and read them later while you’re offline.

In order to make it work, you need to be familiar with Python. You’ll also need to download and install the last version (tested from 0.1.3.3) of libgmail API.
